Gherkin language

 Scenario steps:
 Given.- Pre condition start our test, what we need to reach our goal
 When.-  actions we need to perform, we need to perform action all the operations we perform are under when
 And .-  supporting tag
 Then.-  expected results

 recap.-
 What is framework?
 --> It is an organized structure of folders and packages which allows us to write clean and maintainable code

--> Build management tool.
    Maven

    pom.xml is the main configuration file in maven project.

    Main is to use to write the code for development
    test it is used to write the code to test the application, we need to tools for this:
    -->Java which is for technical/coding we used Java directory
    -->resources is for non-technical/non code we use resources


 Cucumber --> it supports BDD
          --> we use gherkin language(plain english text) to write the scenarios
          --> it works with junit
 Scenario:it is a test case
 Given: Define a pre-condition
 When: Defines the test action that will be executed
 And:Is used to add conditions (supporting tag)
 Then: Results and defines the Outcome of previous steps

 US 12345 - Employee search

 Scenario- Search employee by id
 Given user is navigated to HRMS Application
 When user enters valid admin credentials
 And user clicks on login button
 And user navigates to employee list page
 When user enters valid employee id
 And clicks on search button
 Then user is able to see employee information

 Scenario - Search employee by name
 Given user is navigated to HRMS Application
  When user enters valid admin credentials
  And user clicks on login button
  And user navigates to employee list page
  When user enters valid employee valid name
  And clicks on search button
  Then user is able to see employee information

file where we write BDD scenarios is feature file
this file has .feature extension
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 3
Recap.-
  We use feature file to write our scenarios
  -- search employee by id
  -- search employee by name
In feature file we write scenarios using Gherkin language
--> Given, when, and , then ,scenario,feature

after feature file, we need
all the non-Java needs to be under resources as test data
utils--> constants--> provide unique paths
utils--> Common Methods--> helps implementation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 4

Common methods class in our framework is used to write all the methods we will be using in the majority of
scenarios( Code reusability)

sendText method, click, etc.

in constant class we provide implicit wait, explicit wait values and test data path
Page object model(POM) it's a  design pattern
According to page object model, we create page classes for all the screens available in the application


examples of inheritance in our framework--> When we extend class meaning inheritance the features from the other
class
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 5

Recap:
Creating multiple steps classes for multiple feature files.

Page Object model design pattern: with this we create separate classes in different screens

  What is PageFactory concept?(this is a constructor) We can utilize all the elements from a class , is also
  to initialize all the elements

  In CommonMethods we are calling pageInitialiazers method, this method is going to call the objects of page
  classes which will call the constructor and these constructors will initialize all the Webelements

  Runner class will help us to run all our scripts or scenarios
  In runner clas we are not going to write anything inside the class we will do it outside the class

  Manual Testing --> Test cases
  Smoke Testing is a quick Test, is checking the key functionality of the application in no time

  Regression Testing

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Class 6
  Runner class - we use this class to execute test cases in cucumber

  Cucumber options:
  --> features - path of feature file
  --> glue - to provide the path of steps definitions
  --> dryRun - it provides step definition to add in steps classes
  --> monochrome - if it set to true, it cleans the console
  --> tags- we use tags to execute scenarios in groups
           -- here we use OR and AND to execute scenarios from 2 or more different tags together

  Background:We take common steps from scenarios and put them in background

  Hooks: Only use on steps package, and we use hooks to provide pre-condition and post condition to all the
  scenarios
